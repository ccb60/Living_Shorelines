Location:  Maquoit Bay Conservation Lands, Brunswick
Equipment:  CBEP's Leica TS-07 Total Station
Personnel:  Matt Craig (total station) and Curtis Bohlen (rod), Casco Bay Estuary Partnership

Purpose:  Pre-project baseline data for living shorelines pilot project.

Four cross section transects were established, A, B, C, D.  A was southernmost, toward tidal creek, and D the northernmost, toward the trail end and overlook.

Note:  It was the first time we used the total station and we did not fully understand operation. Data were collected without a full resection process therefore we did not sufficiently tie into the ground control points. Last two points of data set (45 and 46) are MBCLBM02 and MBCLBM03, respectively.

It may be possible to correct the XYZ for this data set by correcting points 45 and 46 to the data for these control stations collected by MGS.
