# Living_Shorelines
Preliminary analysis of data related to three "Living Shorelines" Demonstration 
sites in Casco Bay, Maine.

"Living Shorelines" are hybrid engineered and natural systems designed to
protect shorelines from erosion without triggering the high ecological costs
associated with traditional "gray infrastructure" approaches, such as sea walls
and riprap. Living shorelines are an example of a "Nature Based Solution" to an
engineering problem.

"Living Shorelines" technologies have not been used much in the Northeast. They 
are far more common in the Mid-Atlantic and along the Gulf Coast. The 
hydrodynamics, geology, and ecology of the northeast poses somewhat different 
challenges.  Larger tides, winter ice, a shorter growing season, and small 
populations of native reef-building shellfish may each make project
implementation more dificult in our region.

Several years ago, CBEP participated in a regional project aimed at piloting 
living shorelines technologies across the northeast.  Three sites were selected
in Casco Bay to construct small (~ 50 foot long) "demonstration" structures 
so that we could try out some ideas, track how the structures respond to 
different conditions, and generally advance the "state of the art".

CBEP is responsible for a portion of the long-term monitoring of these three 
structures and the adjacent shorelines.  This repository contains data and 
R code for (a portion of) initial data review, QA/QC, and preliminary data 
analysis.

The purpose of these analyses is to evaluate data quality, develop
analytic concepts for presenting and interpreting long term monitoring data, and 
shed light on the relative value of the monitoring data.

This repository includes limited data from immediately pre-construction to
about one yar post construction.  Additional data may be added later this year.
